            King was a major civil rights leader. His actions directly led to
            the forming of the nation’s first fair housing organization, the
            Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities, which worked
            to credit African American communities and shed light on the
            discrimination of real estate companies.

            <br />
            <br />
            His revolutionary visions of equality remain with us and inspire
            reform to this day.

            at the forefront of open housing marches in Chicago. From 1965 to
            1966, King led the Chicago Freedom Movement to openly call out
            discrimintation. One method that he applied was Testing. Testing
            engaged 2 or more people engaging in a transaction to discover
            whether there was unfairness going on. His actions made the Chicago
            Housing Authority build public housing in white middle-class areas
            and the Mortgage Bankers Association promised to stop discriminatory
            lending policies. -->

            an equal country, which he tried to create using his "Great Society"

            Johnson’s commitment to ending discrimination produced many civil

            Senators Mondale and Brooke were co-authors of Fair Housing Act of
            1968 and key players in its success.

            <br />
            <br />
            Edward Brooke was a leading advocate against housing discrimination,
            repeatedly proposing stronger provisions to the Fair Housing Act. In
            1969 the Brooke Amendment was passed, limiting the rent expenditure
            of tenants in federally assisted housing program to 25% of their
            income. During Nixon’s presidency, he opposed administration
            attempts to weaken the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

            During the civil rights era, NAACP prioritized legislative and
            judicial solutions over King’s direct action. However, they provided
            legal aid and posted bail for members of protest groups. Their
            advocacy helped pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and continues to
            remain critical to the African American community.
