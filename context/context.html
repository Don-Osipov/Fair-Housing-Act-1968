            Restrictive covenants were legal contracts prohibiting the sale of
            houses to a particular group of people, especially African
            Americans. Shelley v. Kraemer prohibited state enforcement of these
            covenants but still allowed private parties to abide by them if they
            wished. Thus, the effect of this decision was minimal, and
            restrictive covenants remained prevalent until outlawed by the Fair
            Housing Act of 1968.

            The GI Bill supported war veterans, with benefits like low interest
            and guaranteed mortgages and loans. However, black veterans usually
            did not qualify due to restrictive criteria, and had trouble finding
            houses. The Department of Veteran Affairs could not administer the
            promised low-interest mortgages itself, so white-run banks refused
            mortgages and loans to black people.

            At its creation, Levittown, PA was meant to be a white-only
            neighborhood. However, while its management refused to sell homes to
            non-Caucasians, private homeowners could. William and Daisy Myers,
            the first blacks in Levittown, obtained their house this way. They
            moved in to a mob throwing rocks and threatening them. The Myers
            received support from various groups and people within the
            community, however. Their battle against discrimination raised
            awareness for other people of color, and helped introduce the Fair
            Housing Act in 1966.
