          <p class="grid-info">
            To convince liberal Republicans to oppose the Fair Housing Act,
            Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois proposed a compromise (that was
            later implemented) that would reduce the bill’s coverage to 80% of
            the nation’s housing, eliminate the HUD’s authority to enforce it,
            and lower penalties for violations.
            <br />
            <br />
            Southern senators, who held key positions in Congress, repeatedly
            thwarted advancements of civil rights. Senator Sam Ervin of North
            Carolina proposed an amendment taking out reference to “race, color,
            religion, or national origin.” He and other Southerners wanted to
            rid the bill of any civil rights connotation, leaving it vague and
            ineffective.

          <p class="grid-info">
            The National Association of Real Estate Brokers’ 1924 code of ethics
            stated that “a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing
            into a neighborhood… members of any race or nationality… whose
            presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that
            neighborhood.” The referral to “race or nationality” was not removed
            until 1950. In 1927, the Chicago Real Estate Board developed a
            restrictive covenant, a private contract between property owners in
            an area who agreed to not sell homes to non-Caucasians. This served
            as a model for neighborhoods and real estate boards across the
            nation. The widely-used underwriting manual of the Federal Housing
            Administration explained that “If a neighborhood is to retain
            stability, it is necessary that properties shall continue to be
            occupied by the same social and racial classes.”

            On April 4th, the day of the Senate vote, Martin Luther King was
            assassinated in Tennessee. This provoked a wave of emotion in more
            than 100 cities in the US, which pushed Lyndon B. Johnson to
            increase pressure on Congress to pass the new civil rights law. It
            finally passed on April 10th, and Johnson signed it the following
            day.
